## Communication Channels

During our recent meeting, it was decided that we will hold daily meetings to
ensure that everyone is aware of the progress being made on the project. During
these meetings, team members will have the opportunity to share updates on the
tasks they are working on, including how much progress has been made thus far.

We understand the importance of effective communication and collaboration in
ensuring the success of this project. As such, we will do our best to keep these
meetings brief and focused, ensuring that everyone is aware of what needs to be
done and what progress has been made.

By staying up-to-date with each other's progress and tasks, we can identify any
potential roadblocks early on and work together to find solutions. We believe
that this daily meeting

we agreed we will be using google meet.

- **Issues**: make sure to create an issue first
- **Pull Requests**: Make sure to make a detailed PR
- **GitHub Discussions** more focussed on slack
- **Slack/Discord**: slack

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
