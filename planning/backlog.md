  pricing plans with scalable resources, so that I can find a cloud hosting
  provider that fits my budget and supports my growing business.

    store, when I search for cloud hosting providers online, then I should be
    able to find pricing plans with flexible resources that fit my budget and
    provide the scalability I need._
